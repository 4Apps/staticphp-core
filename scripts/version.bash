# Print the version the current commit would be released as.

# The version identity lives in two places only, the same split the skeleton uses:
#   .version   - major.minor, hand edited, the one thing a human decides
#   git        - the patch number, derived from the commit count
#
# The patch is the commit count rather than a hand maintained number, so it never needs a
# commit of its own and cannot conflict on a merge. It keeps counting across a minor bump,
# so 2.1 follows 2.0 without the patch resetting and every version sorts after the last.
#
# Prints a bare "2.0.324". scripts/release_tag.bash adds the "v" for the tag name.
